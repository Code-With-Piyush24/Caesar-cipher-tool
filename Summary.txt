Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption
This Python script implements the classic Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting text messages. It shifts letters by a user-defined amount while preserving case and non-alphabetic characters.

Features:

Supports both encryption and decryption modes

Handles uppercase and lowercase letters correctly

Validates user input for mode and shift amount

Keeps non-letter characters unchanged

Usage:
Run the program, choose to encrypt or decrypt, input your message, and specify the shift value (0-25). The program outputs the transformed message accordingly.
